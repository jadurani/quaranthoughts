title: "Day 26: Madness and Indulgence"

I find it extremely difficult to do tasks that involve mostly thinking done, like writing, studying, coding, etc.

I just resorted to cleaning my room first. And eating.

And eating.

And eating.

And eating.

Well hey, it’s my birthweek!

(And yeah, I know I'm just making up excuses to justify this behavior I'm not going to thank myself for in the future.)

In about an hour, I’ll log on to [YogaFix90’s Day 60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMsm6h4lJRM). I’ve been keeping track of this yoga series again, and I’m proud to day I’ve gotten much stronger than the first time I’ve tried this yoga series last 2016.

I went back to the article that prompted me to start this quarantine journal:

[https://news.virginia.edu/content/write-it-down-historian-suggests-keeping-record-life-during-pandemic](https://news.virginia.edu/content/write-it-down-historian-suggests-keeping-record-life-during-pandemic)


I haven’t been able to produce a lot of entries yet, if you see them already finished that’s because I only have drafts for each day and I didn’t really start and finish the entry on the same day. Titling them as “Day X” *is* misleading, but that’s ‘cause of your assumptions. Go blame yourself for not managing your expectations. “Day X” means drafted on Day X.

I'm happy to have stumbled upon [Dry Bar Comedy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvlVuntLjdURVD3b3Hx7kxw) and get clean but still all the way hysterical jokes. PG13 jokes, sure. Not R18. Wholesome jokes you can watch with your parents around. I think it's all the way more creative this way.
