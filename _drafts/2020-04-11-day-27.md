title: "Day 27: Make Things Happen or Let Things Happen"
---

Spirituality and groundedness
Love and light vs fire that enundates your grit to move forward
Let things happen vs make things happen
Do everything within your capacity, or ever expand your capacity to make things happen, while allowing yourself to let other things happen.

This is exactly the subject of Bhagavad-Gita.
You are to perform your duties but you are not to be attached to the result.

It is difficult, sounds bulslhit. 'cause why would you do things in the first place if you didn't want the result?

It is also a big question mark to me.

Will action beat inaction? In which context?

Context is always king.
If you have wings, go fly. But should you get trapped in a spider's web, the more you move, the more you get entangled, the more you send signals to the spider that you, a prey, just got trapped in its web.

Leave it to the perpetually confused.

In the end of it all, context is king.
What's medicine for one is poison for another.
The same sugar that cures jaundice is the death of the diabetic.
The same quotes for the anxious and depressed will worsen the ego of the narcissist.

You can't cater to everyone.
