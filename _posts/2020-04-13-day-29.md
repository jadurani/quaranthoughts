South Koreans are definitely getting their tax money's worth.

## Key Tools In Controlling The Outbreak

1. Diagnostic tests
    - SK gov't collaborated with private companies early on to produce thousands of test kits ready for public consumption
2. Basic prevention measures
    - Contact Tracing System (such as http://coronamap.site/) where you get notified if you're about to enter an area a covid-positive patient just visited.

## Testing and Tracing in the Philippines

*(I'll update this section whenever I get further information.)*

#### Tracing

While lots of volunteer groups are creating their contact tracer apps, I'm not aware of any official one being used by the government yet that has consolidated the data like this one: http://coronamap.site/

DOH does have a case tracker: https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker

But tracking existing cases is just the first part of contact tracing.

#### Efforts

To quote from this [article](https://technology.inquirer.net/97969/ph-govt-to-launch-contact-tracing-app-for-covid-19-cases) published last April 5:
> National Privacy Commission (NPC) chair Raymund Liboro told the Inquirer Sunday they are assisting a team of 15 software engineers and designers from the University of the Philippines (UP) to soon launch the app to the public.

However there's no mention of the app's name yet or the target release date.

I also happen to volunteer at DCTx and one of our projects is a contact tracer app. There's not much progress on that either. (Efforts are focused on other projects such as RapidPass.ph)

#### Testing

DOH's Covid19 Tracker (https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker) does have data on how many testing kits are available in some hospitals.

It would be helpful if we can also see the data on **how many** testing kits are still needed vs how many are PUIs (Person Under Investigation) and PUMs (Person Under Monitoring).

We're not seeing data that could help us prevent further outbreak. We're just seeing how much worse the outbreak is getting. We're just blind.
