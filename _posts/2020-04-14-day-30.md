Ah, memes. Lovely, lovely memes portraying my thousand-word annoyance towards [Nograles' Tiktok dance](https://twitter.com/CabSec_Karlo/status/1248795547772706816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), Duterte's mostly [verbal support](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/25/Duterte-coronavirus-COVID-19-frontliners-doctors.html), and [similar ways of "support"](https://youtu.be/cY38IAmwLRQ).

## Today's Mundanities

### 1 - Farewell, John Conway

Found out about [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway)'s death last April 11 due to Covid19. Not that I'm a huge fan, more of I was just surprised he's actually still alive in our time. ðŸ¤­ I remember implementing his [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) back in college.

### 2 - Learned Some Swag!

Started learning this piece, got up to the 40-minute mark. I'll resume tomorrow. I'm excited!!

### 3 - Coffee Issues

Drank 3 cups of drip coffee today. They're real coffee beans, yes. They're just not as bitter as the coffee I'm used to. My sister ordered 4 whole packs and she's given me full permission to consume them all. Sooo... This should work for now.

Or maybe something's just wrong with my implementation. Maybe less water? Use 2 bags?


### 4 - Applying My Zen

Had to stop myself from lambasting those people I'm referring to in [this post](https://jadurani.github.io/quaranthoughts/2020/04/08/day-24.html) and remind myself of the following:
  - It is useless to argue with those who do not know what they don't know and are not willing to listen. *(Unconscious incompetence)*
  - You do not have the clout nor the position to tell them what to do. *(Hello, sino ka nga ba)*
  - Always strive for a productive communication. Hurting their ego back as a form of revenge will not lead you to the project's desired outcome.
  - Let go of the need to "handle" them. Stick to your duty of managing and communicating the development.

### 5 - Abundance

Absolutely grateful to the universe for the food and the daily life we have here in the temple. I really must have done well in my past lives to not have to worry a lot about my essential needs.

We'll have to procure food packs soon so we can serve our vegetarian meals to our frontliners!!
