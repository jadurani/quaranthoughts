title: "Day 28: Nograles' Tiktok Dance"

__\*Disclaimer\*__

Aside from privacy and data collection issues, I have no issues with the usage of Tiktok itself. I think Tiktok is a fun way of passing time and a good coping mechanism in these trying times.

But it gets a bit much if you're a government official.

## Tiktok and Cabinet Secretary Nograles

I don't mean to shame Nograles... as a person.

As a public official? Yes. It is unbecoming of the Cabinet Secretary to post a tiktok video as a show of support to our frontliners.

Being someone in the position of power, there definitely are lots of ways for Nograles to show real, actual support to our frontliners than cloning a dancing version of himself on video. I mean, I don't know, how about ensuring that our frontliners have enough supplies of PPEs? Providing breakdown on the 275B emergency fund? Auditing where our donations go? Are they being received by the people we intend giving them to instead of getting stocked in warehouses?

## Entertainment and Politics

I'm a bit more concerned about its reception than the actual video, to be honest. On [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS/videos/546227132977574/), it's well-received and people seem happy seeing Nograles dance, complimenting his smiling face and how he can actually dance. #priorities

This shouldn't be surprising though, considering we have an elected senator who just danced budotz during the whole campaign season. No platform, no advocacies. No track record to indicate competency in performing duties as a law-maker. Just lots of commercials dancing budotz. Not to mention the [pending case of plunder](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/218415-timeline-bong-revilla-plunder-case-pork-barrel-scam).

### Our Attitude Towards Problems

*May problema ka ba? Tara inom!*

The way we deal with our personal problems is very telling on  how we'd also face with our national problems. Most of us just turn to entertainment for solutions. *What's going to distract us and make us feel immediately better?* No, no, we don't want to know how to solve our problems the logical, analytical way. That takes too much work, too much pain. We need to feel better **now**. That's what we need to do. Feel better. And we like anyone who makes us feel better. We'll give them what they want 'cause they gave us what we wanted--to feel better. To feel entertained. To feel, at least for a few minutes, that we've laughed our problems away.

We're a nation running on emotions.

And of course our politicians are well-aware of that. They're not stupid. They're smart enough to know how to get the people's sympathy and how a tiktok video should be enough for the week to whisk people's ire away.
